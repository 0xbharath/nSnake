Installing information for the game nSnake.
This applies to GNU/Linux systems and presumably to similar ones.

        6)  Advanced Installation
        7)  Uninstallation
        8)  Advanced Uninstallation

3) Dependences
--------------

To build nSnake from source, it requires the ncurses developer library:
      libncurses5-dev (>= 5.7)

Note that this is not the one that comes by default with the distribution.
To get ncurses-dev, use your favorite package manager.
An 'apt' example:

        $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
or
        $ sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev

4) Installation
---------------
Briefly, the following shell commands should configure, build, and install
this package on the default directories:

        $ make
        $ sudo make install

5) Installation Informations
----------------------------
By default, 'make install' installs the package on the following
directories:

        /usr/local/games/                    Executable files
        /usr/local/share/man/man6/           Man page
        /home/$USER/.nsnake/high-scores.bin  HighScore file

6) Advanced Installation
------------------------
You can specify a custom root directory for the installation (other
than '/'). To do this, give 'make install' the option DESTDIR=CUSTOM_ROOT,
where CUSTOM_ROOT must be an absolute directory name.
For example:

        $ make install DESTDIR=test/dir

This way, the file hierarchy will be:

        test/dir/usr/local/games/            Executable files
        test/dir/usr/local/share/man/man6/   Man page
        /home/$USER/.nsnake/high-scores.bin  HighScore file

You can also specify an installation prefix other than '/usr/local' by
giving 'make' the option PREFIX=CUSTOM_PREFIX, where CUSTOM_PREFIX must be an
absolute directory name.
For example:

	$ make install PREFIX=test/dir

This way, the file hierarchy will be:

        test/dir/games/                      Executable files
        test/dir/share/man/man6/             Man page
        /home/$USER/.nsnake/high-scores.bin  HighScore file

To customize the highscores file, modify SCORE_FILE:

	$ make install SCORE_FILE=my-scores.data

This way, the highscore file will be:

        /home/$USER/.nsnake/my-scores.data

7) Uninstallation
-----------------
To uninstall this package, by default:

        $ sudo make uninstall

To purge (remove also the HighScore file and Man page) go for:

        $ sudo make purge

8) Advanced Uninstallation
--------------------------

If you specified a custom root directory for installation, 'make' needs to
know about it to uninstall properly:

        $ make uninstall DESTDIR=test/dir

The same logic applies to purging:

        $ make purge DESTDIR=test/dir

If you installed it with a custom prefix, do the same:

        $ make uninstall PREFIX=test/dir

        $ make purge PREFIX=test/dir

        $ make purge SCORE_FILE=my-score.data
