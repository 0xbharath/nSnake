If you try to run nSnake with parameters that don't start with '-', they are
completely ignored.
(Fix probably at getopt_long at arguments.c)

When the fruit is at the bottom of the screen and the snake tries to eat it
on the borderless mode teleporting from above, it doesn't get eaten - the
snake goes through it.
(Fix at collision detection)
