nsnake README
=============
nsnake is the classic snake game playable on the console.
It has two modes (with or without borders) and 9 speed levels.
Uses the nCurses C library for text-like interface.

This is the README for nsnake (also known as "nsnake++").
It is a complete rewrite of nsnake in C++.
The source code is highly documented and clean, although it's
architecture is not that simple.

For the classic nsnake in C, check out the "nsnake-classic"
branch on git. The source is way simpler and easy to build upon.

1) Introduction
---------------
The rules are the same of any snake game:

You control a hungry snake and the objective is to eat as many fruits you can.
Each fruit eaten increases it's size by two units.

The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. Currently,
nsnake has two modes: With Borders and without borders.

To each fruit is given a bonus value, which decreases over time. So the
challenge is to earn the biggest score possible by eating as many fruits as
you can.

Good luck!

10) Credits
-----------
Firstly, I'd like to thank you for playing this game. Hope you liked it!

The whole game design, coding, documenting, packaging and testing were all
made by me, on my free time.

But I didn't do everything! Throughout the nsnake development, I found very
interesting sources of ideas - such as games who also uses nCurses for
displaying graphics. They have simple, short and commented source-codes that
can be used as references to learn C programming.

Special thanks to:

    nInvaders:	A space invaders-like game using ncurses.
        homepage:	http://ninvaders.sourceforge.net
        comments:	"Thanks for the inspiration. If I
                     haven't installed this in first place,
                     I'd never have the idea for nsnake"

        comments:	"This package is awesome, 'cause it
                     uses ncurses AND pdcurses to be able
                     to play in Windows and GNU/Linux"
